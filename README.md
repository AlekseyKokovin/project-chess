Welcome to my Python Chess Project! This is my first dive into creating a fully functioning chess game from scratch using Python. The project is designed to offer a complete chess experience, allowing players to engage in a classic game against an AI-powered bot.

Features:
- Interactive Gameplay: The game features a standard 8x8 chessboard with all traditional chess rules.
- AI-Powered Bot: The opponent is an AI-based bot that makes decisions based on basic chess strategies, providing a fun challenge for beginners and enthusiasts alike.
- Move Validation: The game includes robust move validation, ensuring legal moves and enforcing all rules such as check, checkmate, castling, and pawn promotion.
- Simple GUI Interface: The game can be played through a graphical interface, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
- Learning Experience: The project was developed as a learning exercise, covering essential Python concepts like object-oriented programming, algorithms, and decision-making in AI.

This project represents my first step into game development and AI with Python, combining strategy and coding in an exciting way. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed building it!
